<div class="answer"><ul>
    <li>Start your own little projects when you can, so you can give yourself the opportunity to put what
        you’ve
        learned into practice somewhere where you’ll see immediate results (no waiting on co-workers to
        approve
        Code Reviews, no needing enough permissions to make changes, etc), and figuring out what works well
        and
        what doesn’t. You might even end up with something cool that could actually make you some money
    </li>
    <li>Be a life long learner. In tech there is so much to know from frontend to microservices to design to
        product development. Sure, you won't be able to learn and master everything. Rather focus on what
        you
        are passionate about and the progress you have made so far
    </li>
    <li>Always try to remix the result if you followed a tutorial/walktrhough. See if you can implement the
        thing in another way, add a new feature, try explaining it to someone else
    </li>
    <li>Put yourself out there. Networking sounds lame, but going to meetups, talking to people involved in
        the
        tech community or attending hackathons opens up many opportunities you would find on regular job
        listings
    </li>
